## Introduction
This website showcases interactive visualizations created for Assignment 5 of the JSC370 course, using data from my final project. The analysis investigates how weather conditions and hourly patterns influence Bike Share usage in Toronto, drawing from datasets provided by the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Bike Share Toronto Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto-ridership-data/).

Navigate to the [Interactive Visuals](visuals.html) page to explore these dynamic visualizations and uncover insights into bike trip behaviors and predictive modeling results.
